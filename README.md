# PacMan Auto Find Food using Search Algorithms 

This project implements search algorithms for solving Pacman maze problems, where Pacman must find food in a grid-based world. The AI solves Single-Food Search and Multi-Food Search problems using various search strategies.

Search algorithms used in this project:

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

A Search (A*)*

Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
